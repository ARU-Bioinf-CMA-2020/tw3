    "\n",
    "Graphs can be most simply described by giving each node a number and then keeping track of the nodes connected to each node. One way to do this is to make a list for each node of the adjacent nodes - its adjacency list. Then the graph can be a list of these lists where the index for each adjacency list corresponds to the number of the node it belongs to. \n",
    "\n",
    "Letters for each node can be labels to help see the structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "For two nodes a (node 0) and b (node 1) connected in an undirected graph, 1 ('b') has to occur in 0's adjacency list. And 0 ('a') has to occur in 1's adjacency list. \n",
    "\n",
    "In more useful representations the nodes can be tuples with the labels explicitly associated with the numbers. But for the traversals below numbers will do as we are just interested in the order that the nodes are reported.\n",
